# Design System — Pick Me a Dinner

The canonical visual system. Code, components, and review must follow this
file. The typography, spacing, layout, and motion sections were implemented
in code on 2026-05-16. **The Color section was revised on 2026-05-17 via
`/design-shotgun` and is not yet implemented** — `app/globals.css`,
`tailwind.config.ts`, and the screens still carry the prior warm palette (see
"Implementation note" below).

## Product Context

- **What this is:** A personal web app that helps one household decide what's
  for dinner each night — a ranked, explained list of dinner Options.
- **Who it's for:** A single household. No accounts, one shared password. The
  owner uses it on a phone in the kitchen and on a desktop.
- **Space/industry:** Personal/bespoke utility. Deliberately *not* a consumer
  recipe app — the honest peers are precise personal instruments (Linear,
  Things, transit arrival boards, dense data tables).
- **Project type:** Data-dense web app (Next.js App Router + Tailwind).

## Memorable Thing

**A sharp instrument** — dense, precise, confident. A sharp tool that does one
job. Every decision below serves this: density without clutter, precision in
the numbers, and functional color so the dense list parses at a glance.

## Aesthetic Direction

- **Direction:** Industrial / utilitarian, leaning *field instrument*.
- **Decoration level:** Minimal — typography and hairline rules do all the
  work. No shadows, no cards, no nested surfaces, no icons-in-circles, no
  decorative imagery.
- **Mood:** Looks like it was built by someone who actually uses it at 5:37pm.
  Quiet, dense, slightly austere — the relief of a tool that is just *right*
  rather than trying to delight.

## Typography

All three faces are free, open-source, and loaded via `next/font` (self-hosted,
no CDN, no layout shift).

- **Display — Fraunces.** Screen titles and the dinner-Option name. A warm
  modern serif with optical sizing. This is the single deliberate note of
  personality — used at display sizes only, never for body or UI text.
- **Body / UI — Geist.** Tags, buttons, labels, body copy, form fields. Tight
  grotesque engineered for product UI; ships with Next.js, so it is maximally
  proven for this stack.
- **Data — Geist Mono**, with `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`. Rank
  numbers, dates, and every numeral in an Explanation chip ("18" in "No fish in
  18 days"). The mono is the instrument readout — it makes numbers align to the
  pixel down a column. Use it for numerals and dates only, not whole sentences.
- **Scale** (px):
  - `h1` screen title — Fraunces, 28px / weight 600
  - `name` Option name — Fraunces, 18px / weight 500
  - `body` — Geist, 15px / weight 400 / line-height 1.5
  - `chip` Explanation chip text — Geist 13px (numerals in Geist Mono 13px)
  - `meta` tags, rank, dates, secondary labels — Geist / Geist Mono 12px
  - emphasis weight — 600

## Color

- **Approach:** Functional color on a cool-neutral base. Color is no longer
  rare — it does two specific jobs on every dinner row: it codes *meal kind*
  and it maps *recency*. Everything else stays neutral so those two signals
  read instantly. The light theme is primary; dark mode is a derived theme
  (below). Revised 2026-05-17 via `/design-shotgun` (see Decisions Log) — the
  Tonight screen was the explored canvas; the same tokens propagate to the
  other screens.

### Two color channels

Every Tonight row carries exactly two color signals:

1. **Meal kind** — a 3px solid vertical bar on the row's left edge. Teal
   `kind-home` for home-cooked Options, plum `kind-restaurant` for
   restaurants. One calm decision per row: home vs out, before reading a word.
2. **Recency heatmap** — a continuous red→green scale. An Option (or a Tag)
   long overdue reads green ("go ahead"); one eaten recently reads red ("you
   just had this"); the scale fades through a muted tan midpoint. The heatmap
   colors the Explanation chip background and tints each Tag word by that
   Tag's own recency. Because Tonight is ranked best-first, the list runs
   green at the top to red at the bottom.

### Light theme (primary)

| Token | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `bg` | `#f3f4f6` | App background (cool grey) |
| `surface` | `#ffffff` | Card-less content surface, modals, inputs base |
| `raised` | `#e8eaed` | Input fill, neutral (non-recency) chip background |
| `ink` | `#25282d` | Primary text |
| `muted` | `#767a82` | Tags baseline, dates, secondary text, rank numbers |
| `line` | `#d8dade` | Hairline rules and borders |
| `kind-home` | `#2c6e6e` | Meal-kind left bar — home-cooked (teal) |
| `kind-restaurant` | `#7a4f6b` | Meal-kind left bar — restaurant (plum) |
| `recency-overdue` | `#3f8a4a` | Recency heatmap — green end, long overdue |
| `recency-mid` | `#c8b78f` | Recency heatmap — muted tan midpoint |
| `recency-recent` | `#c4453a` | Recency heatmap — red end, eaten recently |
| `action` | `#2c2f36` | PICK button fill (charcoal-ink) |
| `action-hover` | `#3c4049` | PICK hover / pressed |
| `action-ink` | `#ffffff` | Text/label on the PICK fill |
| `success` | `#3f8a4a` | Confirmation, success feedback (shares the green) |
| `danger` | `#c4453a` | Destructive actions, errors (shares the red) |
| `planned` | `#b9822b` | Amber — the Upcoming planned-dinner section |

`recency-overdue` / `recency-mid` / `recency-recent` are the three anchor
stops of a continuous scale; the implementation interpolates between them,
applying the result at low opacity for Explanation chip backgrounds and at
higher strength for Tag text. The PICK button is a neutral charcoal so it
never collides with the green end of the heatmap.

The earlier excluded-tag-filter chip token (`exclude`) is carried over from
the prior warm system and should be re-tuned against this cool base when the
Tonight tag filters get their own visual pass — it was not part of this
exploration.

### Dark theme

Derived from the light theme — cool dark surfaces, the same kind / recency /
action hues lifted for contrast. **Derived, not yet visually verified** —
check before relying on it.

| Token | Hex |
|---|---|
| `bg` | `#1a1c1f` |
| `surface` | `#232629` |
| `raised` | `#2c2f33` |
| `ink` | `#e6e7ea` |
| `muted` | `#8b8f98` |
| `line` | `#383b40` |
| `kind-home` | `#4a9a9a` |
| `kind-restaurant` | `#a87d99` |
| `recency-overdue` | `#5aa863` |
| `recency-mid` | `#bdae89` |
| `recency-recent` | `#d65a4f` |
| `action` | `#e6e7ea` |
| `action-ink` | `#1a1c1f` |
| `planned` | `#cf9a45` |

## Spacing

- **Base unit:** 4px.
- **Density:** Compact. Tonight rows use ~10–12px vertical padding so more
  Options are visible per screen without scrolling.
- **Scale:** 2xs(2) xs(4) sm(8) md(12) lg(16) xl(24) 2xl(32) 3xl(48).

## Layout

- **Approach:** Hybrid — a disciplined ledger grid with a real responsive
  *structural* shift between mobile and desktop (not just a wider column).
- **Mobile (< 720px):** Single centered column, max-width 560px. Bottom tab
  bar: Tonight / Log / Catalog. Tonight rows are two-line — rank + Option name +
  tags on the first line group, Explanation chip + PICK on the row.
- **Desktop (≥ 720px):** Bottom tab bar is replaced by a persistent left rail
  (~200px) holding the same nav. Content column to its right, max-width 700px.
  Tonight rows collapse to a single dense line: rank + name + tags on the left,
  Explanation chip center, PICK on the right edge. Keyboard-navigable.
- **Tonight row anatomy:** A flat, uniform ledger — every row the same height,
  separated by a 1px `line` rule, no cards, no shadows, no row given a
  different background. A 3px vertical meal-kind bar (`kind-home` /
  `kind-restaurant`) sits flush on the row's left edge. Rank number in Geist
  Mono `muted`. Option name in Fraunces, uncolored. Tags as plain lowercase
  Geist text directly under the name, each tinted on the recency heatmap by
  that tag's own recency (overdue greener, recent redder). Explanation chip
  background carries the recency-heatmap color for the Option, its numerals in
  Geist Mono. PICK as a filled `action` (charcoal-ink) button with
  `action-ink` label. The uniform flat list is intentional and locked — no
  lead-item prominence, no collapsed long tail, no per-row background tint.
- **Border radius:** badge/chip 3px, inputs 6px, buttons/controls 6px. Sharp
  crisp corners suit a sharp tool — no pill shapes except where a control is
  genuinely circular.

## Motion

- **Approach:** Minimal-functional — only transitions that aid comprehension.
  No bounce, no scroll choreography. A sharp instrument does not animate for
  personality.
- **Easing:** enter `ease-out`, exit `ease-in`, move `ease-in-out`.
- **Duration:** micro 80ms (hover/press), short 140ms (state change), medium
  220ms (inline expand, e.g. Catalog edit).
- **Destructive actions** use inline-confirm (the row reveals a confirm/cancel
  in place) rather than a modal — consistent with the plan's §17.

## Implementation note

This system was implemented in the code on 2026-05-16. Fraunces is loaded via
`next/font/google` and Geist / Geist Mono via the `geist` package, all exposed
as CSS variables on `<html>` in `app/layout.tsx`. `app/globals.css` carries the
full light + dark token sets, and `tailwind.config.ts` mirrors them. The
mobile-bottom-nav → desktop-left-rail shift lives in `app/app-nav.tsx` (the
720px `desktop:` breakpoint). All four screens and the loading states consume
the tokens; the per-row tags on Tonight render as a plain muted text run that
keeps each tag's recency (with overdue tags emphasized).

**Color revision pending (2026-05-17):** the Color section above was replaced
via `/design-shotgun` — a cool-grey base with the two-channel
kind-bar + red→green recency-heatmap system. The code still carries the prior
warm palette in `app/globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`. Applying the new
tokens, the Tonight row's left-edge kind bar and recency heatmap (Explanation
chip + per-tag tint), the charcoal PICK button, and a visual check of the
re-derived dark theme are a follow-up implementation task.

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-05-16 | Design system created via `/design-consultation` | Memorable thing: "a sharp instrument". Emphasis: data density + ease of use on mobile and desktop. |
| 2026-05-16 | Fraunces (display) / Geist (body) / Geist Mono (data) | Codex and a Claude subagent both independently reached for a serif display; grotesque body chosen over a serif body for legibility in dense lists; mono carries the instrument-readout feel. All free, `next/font`-loadable. |
| 2026-05-16 | Keep the warm §16 palette, refined | Approved in the earlier plan design review. Hairline darkened to `#ded6c8` for crisp rules; added `accent-dark`, `planned` amber, `raised`. |
| 2026-05-16 | Desktop = persistent left rail, not a wider column | User chose to include it: desktop gets its own identity and more density instead of feeling like a stretched phone. |
| 2026-05-16 | PICK = filled clay button; Tonight rows compact | User decisions. PICK is the app's single primary action — must be unmissable; compact density serves the data-density brief. |
| 2026-05-17 | Color system revised via `/design-shotgun`: cool-grey base, two-channel kind-bar + red→green recency heatmap | The prior warm palette read as too monochrome to parse quickly. Six rounds of Tonight-screen mockups; user chose the cool-slate base with teal/plum meal-kind left bars and a red→green recency heatmap on the Explanation chip and per-tag text. PICK moved from clay to neutral charcoal so it never collides with the heatmap's green. Spec only — not yet in code. |
