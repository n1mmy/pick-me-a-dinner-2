"""PreToolUse path-guard hook for the Ralph loop.

A worker sub-agent runs with `isolation: "worktree"`, which isolates its git
branch and index but NOT the filesystem — `Write` / `Edit` / `NotebookEdit` can
target any absolute path the OS permits. This hook is the filesystem guard: it
denies any of those calls whose target resolves outside the worktree the call
runs in.

Wired by `.ralph/settings.json` under `hooks.PreToolUse`. Reads the hook event
JSON on stdin. On a violation it prints a deny decision and exits 0; otherwise
it exits 0 silently so normal permission processing continues.

Fail-open by design: if the event cannot be parsed, the cwd is missing, or
the worktree root cannot be resolved, the hook does not block. A crashing
guard must never wedge an unattended run — the orchestrator's post-wave
escape checks are the backstop.
